# DeepLearning Excercise Books(Completed)
# Abstract

# The students gain a comprehensive understanding of essential predictive analytics techniques and develop proficiency in using common standard tools, such as, e.g., Python, Tensorflow, Keras, and Scikit-learn, to perform independent analyses. They learn to critically evaluate the validity and relevance of results and apply their newfound skills to tackle new and complex scenarios objectively. By the end of the module, students will have developed a strong foundation in predictive analytics, allowing them to make informed decisions and solve real-world problems using data-driven insights. The students prove their application-oriented knowledge and competences by solving well-defined problems and exercises during a practical examination. This form of examination also evaluates the studentâ€™s interpretation capabilities.
